1. Scenario: Verify if the Logger instance is correctly produced when a valid InjectionPoint is provided
   - Given a valid InjectionPoint instance
   - When the produceLogger method is called with this instance
   - Then the method should return a Logger instance with the name set as the declaring class of the InjectionPoint's member

2. Scenario: Check if the Logger instance is null when a null InjectionPoint is provided
   - Given a null InjectionPoint instance
   - When the produceLogger method is called with this instance
   - Then the method should throw a NullPointerException

3. Scenario: Verify if the Logger instance is correctly produced when InjectionPoint's member is an anonymous class
   - Given an InjectionPoint instance whose member is an anonymous class
   - When the produceLogger method is called with this instance
   - Then the method should return a Logger instance with the name set as the anonymous class

4. Scenario: Check if the Logger instance is correctly produced when InjectionPoint's member is an inner class
   - Given an InjectionPoint instance whose member is an inner class
   - When the produceLogger method is called with this instance
   - Then the method should return a Logger instance with the name set as the inner class

5. Scenario: Verify if the Logger instance is correctly produced when InjectionPoint's member is a static class
   - Given an InjectionPoint instance whose member is a static class
   - When the produceLogger method is called with this instance
   - Then the method should return a Logger instance with the name set as the static class

6. Scenario: Check if the Logger instance is correctly produced when InjectionPoint's member is a member of a superclass
   - Given an InjectionPoint instance whose member is a member of a superclass
   - When the produceLogger method is called with this instance
   - Then the method should return a Logger instance with the name set as the superclass

7. Scenario: Verify if the Logger instance is correctly produced when InjectionPoint's member is a member of an interface
   - Given an InjectionPoint instance whose member is a member of an interface
   - When the produceLogger method is called with this instance
   - Then the method should return a Logger instance with the name set as the interface.
