ROOST_METHOD_HASH=equals_cc1252f459
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=equals_f2d574000d

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: The code checks equality using the '==' operator for objects instead of 'equals()', which can lead to incorrect comparisons because '==' compares references, not values.
Solution: Replace the '==' operator with 'equals()' for object comparison.

Vulnerability: CWE-495: Private Data Exposure
Issue: The equals method is directly accessing the 'isoCode' property of another 'Country' object which might not be safe if the field is supposed to be encapsulated and private.
Solution: Use getter methods to access private fields when comparing objects.

Vulnerability: CWE-497: Exposure of System Data
Issue: Without a clear understanding of what the 'isoCode' contains, it could potentially expose sensitive system or configuration data if it is logged or serialized.
Solution: Sanitize or exclude sensitive information from 'isoCode' before using it in logs or external outputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
Issue: The equals method potentially modifies the state of the 'isoCode' without proper checks, which can be a vulnerability if 'isoCode' can be dynamically determined.
Solution: Ensure that the 'isoCode' attribute is not modifiable by untrusted sources before using them in security-sensitive operations.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Compare Identical Instances

Details:
  TestName: compareIdenticalInstances
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns true when the same instance of an object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the 'Country' class.
  Act: Call the equals method, passing the instance itself as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the 'equals' contract is maintained when an object is compared with itself. The test is significant because it ensures that the reflexivity property of the equals method is upheld.

Scenario 2: Compare With Null

Details:
  TestName: compareToNull
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when the provided object is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the 'Country' class.
  Act: Call the equals method, passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that comparing an object with null correctly returns false, thus adhering to the equals contract. This test is significant as it ensures robustness in the presence of null values.

Scenario 3: Compare With Different Class

Details:
  TestName: compareWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when compared with an object of a different class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the 'Country' class and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals method on the 'Country' instance, passing the instance of the different class.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the class comparison aspect of the equals method. The test is meaningful to guarantee that the method correctly identifies the class types are not the same and returns false accordingly.

Scenario 4: Compare With Equal Objects

Details:
  TestName: compareWithEqualObjects
  Description: Examine whether the equals method returns true for two different instances of the 'Country' class with equal 'isoCode' values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the 'Country' class with the same 'isoCode' value.
  Act: Call the equals method on one instance, passing the other instance as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This test verifies the comparison of the key 'isoCode' attribute between two 'Country' objects. It's significant to confirm that objects representing the same data are considered equal by the equals method.

Scenario 5: Compare With Nonequal Objects

Details:
  TestName: compareWithNonequalObjects
  Description: This test checks the equals method for returning false when comparing 'Country' objects with different 'isoCode' values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two 'Country' class instances with different 'isoCode' values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one of the instances, comparing it with the other.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion certifies that the equals method correctly identifies unequal 'isoCode' values and thus prevents different 'Country' instances from being considered equal. This test upholds the accuracy of object comparisons within business logic concerning Country identity.
