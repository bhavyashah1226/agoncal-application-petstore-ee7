================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The usage of third-party libraries without proper integrity checks could lead to the execution of malicious code.
Solution: Ensure all dependencies are downloaded over a secure channel and verified using signatures or checksums before using them.

Vulnerability: CWE-497: Exposure of System Data (java.io.Serializable)
Issue: Implementing Serializable without careful consideration can inadvertently expose internal system data during serialization.
Solution: If serialization is required, carefully control what is serialized and consider using custom serialization methods or transient fields to protect sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If input data is used to build SQL queries, there's a risk of SQL injection without proper input sanitation or use of prepared statements.
Solution: Use Prepared Statements (java.sql.PreparedStatement) with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Lack of validation for input data can lead to various attacks such as injection, buffer overflow, and more
Solution: Use validators and robust error handling for all user supplied input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and values.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Deserializing data from untrusted sources can result in execution of arbitrary code.
Solution: Avoid deserialization of objects from untrusted sources or implement strict checks to ensure the safety of the deserialized data.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: Without proper account lockout mechanisms, an attacker could brute force passwords.
Solution: Implement account lockout features and rate-limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test hash code with non-null isoCode

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNonNullIsoCode
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method returns a consistent hash code for a non-null isoCode value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific non-null isoCode value.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code calculated using `Objects.hash` with the same isoCode value.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the hash code generated by the method is as expected for a given non-null isoCode. This is important to ensure that objects with the same isoCode are bucketed correctly in hash-based collections, such as HashSet or HashMap.

Scenario 2: Test hash code with null isoCode

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNullIsoCode
  Description: This test ensures that the hashCode method can handle a null isoCode value without throwing an exception and returns a consistent hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a null isoCode value.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code calculated using `Objects.hash` with a null value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null isoCode values, generating a hash code that matches the expected result. This is significant for the correct functioning of hash-based collections that may contain objects with null fields.

Scenario 3: Test hash code consistency for the same object

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistencyForSameObject
  Description: This test checks the consistency of the hashCode method by calling it multiple times on the same object instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific non-null isoCode value.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all invocations return the same hash code value.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the hash code of an object remains consistent across multiple invocations, which is a key requirement of the hashCode contract. This consistency is vital for the correct operation of hash-based collections.

Scenario 4: Test hash code differences for different isoCode values

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeDifferencesForDifferentIsoCodes
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates different hash codes for objects with different non-null isoCode values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the class with different non-null isoCode values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash codes are different.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that different isoCode values result in different hash codes, which helps minimize collisions in hash-based collections. While hash collisions can still occur, this test ensures that the implementation of hashCode helps to differentiate distinct objects.

Scenario 5: Test hash code for known isoCode value

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeForKnownIsoCodeValue
  Description: This test explicitly verifies the hashCode method against a known isoCode value and its expected hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a specific-known non-null isoCode value.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the pre-calculated expected hash code.
Validation: 
  This assertion confirms that for known values, the hashCode method returns the correct hash code. This test can be useful as a sanity check and to detect changes in the hashing algorithm that could affect object equality in collections.

Scenario 6: Test hash code with empty isoCode

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithEmptyIsoCode
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashCode method when the isoCode is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with an empty isoCode value (i.e., "").
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code calculated using `Objects.hash` with an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that even empty strings are handled correctly by the method, yielding the proper hash code. Such a test is significant because empty strings are valid values and should not lead to unexpected behavior in hash-based collections.
