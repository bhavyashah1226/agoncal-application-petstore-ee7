================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: This code does not demonstrate any session management, which could lead to insufficient session expiration vulnerabilities if sessions are not properly managed elsewhere in the application.
Solution: Implement session expiration and management policies. Use frameworks that automatically handle session IDs, ensuring they are invalidated after logout or a period of inactivity.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The usage of `MessageDigest` for hashing without specifying the algorithm could lead to the use of weak hashes. Weak or compromised hashing algorithms can be exploited for data tampering or password cracking.
Solution: Always specify a strong hashing algorithm when using `MessageDigest`. Prefer algorithms like SHA-256 or higher for cryptographic purposes. Avoid MD5 and SHA-1 as they are considered weak.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The application might be vulnerable to XSS if user-controlled data is rendered in the browser without proper encoding or validation, especially if using `@XmlRootElement` and related annotations without sanitizing input.
Solution: Sanitize and validate all user input, especially data bound for browser execution. Employ context-aware output encoding to prevent XSS. Use libraries like OWASP ESAPI for input validation.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The application may not be validating input properly everywhere, particularly with custom constraints (`@Login` and `@Email`). If these constraints do not adequately validate input, it could lead to injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure custom validation annotations like `@Email` and `@Login` perform strict validation against known patterns and reject any suspicious or malformed inputs. Use existing validation frameworks and libraries where possible.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The method `equals` could potentially throw a `NullPointerException` if `login` is null, leading to information exposure through error messages.
Solution: Implement null checks in the `equals` method before using the `login` field. Additionally, catch exceptions that may result in unwanted information exposure and handle them gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the application constructs SQL queries directly using inputs from the `login` or other fields without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection.
Solution: Use Prepared Statements (with parameterized queries) for all database access. This approach ensures that user input is handled in a way that makes injection attacks impossible.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Equality Check Between Two Customer Objects

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityForSameCustomerObjects
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns true when comparing a Customer object with itself, ensuring the method correctly identifies self-comparison as equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a single Customer object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Customer object, passing itself as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  This test validates that the equals method correctly handles self-comparison, a fundamental aspect of object equality. It's significant for ensuring basic object integrity and consistency in behavior across the application.

Scenario 2: Equality Check With Null

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when comparing a Customer object with null, verifying the method's handling of null references.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Customer object.
  Act: Call the equals method on the Customer object, passing null as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  This test confirms the equals method's robustness in handling null references, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions and ensuring stable application behavior.

Scenario 3: Equality Check With Different Class Objects

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityWithDifferentClass
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when comparing a Customer object with an object of a different class, ensuring type specificity in equality checks.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Customer object and an object of a different class (e.g., String).
  Act: Call the equals method on the Customer object, passing the object of a different class as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures class type integrity in equality checks, which is crucial for maintaining logical consistency and avoiding erroneous equality assertions between unrelated object types.

Scenario 4: Equality Check Between Two Different Customer Objects

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityForDifferentCustomers
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when comparing two Customer objects with different 'login' field values, ensuring the method correctly identifies differences in critical fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two Customer objects with different 'login' values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Customer object, passing the other Customer object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
Validation:
  This test checks the equals method's ability to correctly differentiate between Customer objects based on their 'login' field, which is essential for accurate entity distinction and data integrity within the application.

Scenario 5: Successful Equality Check Between Two Identical Customer Objects

Details:
  TestName: checkEqualityForIdenticalCustomers
  Description: This test confirms that the equals method returns true when comparing two Customer objects with the same 'login' field values, indicating correct identification of equality based on a critical attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate two Customer objects with the same 'login' values.
  Act: Call the equals method on one Customer object, passing the second Customer object as the argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
Validation:
  This test validates the equals method's capability to recognize identical Customer objects based on the 'login' field, crucial for ensuring object uniqueness and consistency in handling user identity across the application.
