================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Lack of input validation for the fields street1, city, and zipcode can lead to various security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, if these fields are used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
Solution: Implement input validation for all fields using Java's standard input validation mechanisms or custom validation logic. Use @Size, @Pattern, or @NotNull annotations for basic validations and consider using a more robust validation framework for complex requirements.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing sensitive information through error messages or logging without adequate protection can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not logged or exposed in error messages. Use logging frameworks that support filtering of sensitive information and review error messages to ensure they do not reveal sensitive details.

Vulnerability: CWE-488: Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session
Issue: Without proper session management, data could be exposed to users from a different session, leading to unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that session management is correctly implemented, particularly in web applications. Utilize Java EE's built-in session management capabilities and ensure that data stored in sessions is properly secured and isolated per user session.

Vulnerability: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
Issue: If the hashCode method is used in contexts where the hash values are not properly controlled, it could lead to an object's attributes being modified in an unintended manner.
Solution: Review the usage of the hashCode method to ensure that it is not used in ways that could allow an attacker to modify object attributes unexpectedly. Consider using immutable objects or ensuring that object attributes cannot be changed from outside the class.

================================================================================
Given the description and the task to generate test scenarios for a `hashCode` method that computes a hash based on `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`, here are several test scenarios that could be considered:

### Scenario 1: Valid HashCode Generation

**Details:**  
TestName: generateValidHashCode  
Description: This test verifies that the hashCode method generates a consistent hash code for given valid inputs. It checks if the method properly utilizes the `Objects.hash` method with `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode` to compute the hash.

**Execution:**  
Arrange: Instantiate the object with specific `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode` values.  
Act: Invoke the `hashCode` method on the instantiated object.  
Assert: Assert that the returned hash code matches the expected hash code computed using the same values for `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode` with `Objects.hash`.  

**Validation:**  
This test validates that the `hashCode` method accurately computes the hash code based on the provided fields. It ensures the consistency and correctness of hash code computation, which is crucial for the object's behavior in collections like HashMap or HashSet.

### Scenario 2: Consistent HashCode for Same Object

**Details:**  
TestName: hashCodeConsistencyCheck  
Description: This test ensures that multiple invocations of the `hashCode` method on the same object instance return the same hash code value, indicating consistency.

**Execution:**  
Arrange: Create an instance of the object with predetermined `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.  
Act: Invoke the `hashCode` method on the instance twice.  
Assert: Assert that both invocations return the same hash code.  

**Validation:**  
This scenario checks the consistency of the hash code generated by the same object across multiple calls. This property is essential for the correct operation of hash-based collections.

### Scenario 3: Different HashCode for Different Objects

**Details:**  
TestName: differentHashCodeForDifferentObjects  
Description: This test checks that two objects with different `street1`, `city`, or `zipcode` values produce different hash codes, ensuring the hash function's sensitivity to the values of its fields.

**Execution:**  
Arrange: Instantiate two objects with different `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.  
Act: Invoke the `hashCode` method on both objects.  
Assert: Assert that the hash codes of the two objects are not the same.  

**Validation:**  
This test ensures that objects with different field values are likely to have different hash codes, which is crucial for minimizing collisions in hash-based collections.

### Scenario 4: Same HashCode for Equal Objects

**Details:**  
TestName: sameHashCodeForEqualObjects  
Description: This scenario verifies that two objects with the same `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode` values produce the same hash code, adhering to the contract between `equals` and `hashCode`.

**Execution:**  
Arrange: Create two different instances of the object with the same `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.  
Act: Invoke the `hashCode` method on both instances.  
Assert: Assert that both instances return the same hash code.  

**Validation:**  
This scenario checks the fulfillment of the contract that equal objects must have the same hash code. This is critical for the correct operation of hash-based collections where objects are considered equal.

### Scenario 5: Handling of Null Values

**Details:**  
TestName: hashCodeWithNullValues  
Description: This test ensures that the `hashCode` method can handle `null` values for `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode` without throwing an exception, producing a valid hash code.

**Execution:**  
Arrange: Instantiate the object with `null` values for `street1`, `city`, and `zipcode`.  
Act: Invoke the `hashCode` method on the object.  
Assert: Assert that the method returns a hash code without throwing an exception.  

**Validation:**  
This scenario tests the robustness of the `hashCode` method in handling `null` values, ensuring that the application remains stable and functional even when data is incomplete.
