Test generated by RoostGPT for test pomXmlTest using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

Test Scenario 1: Identical Objects
- Given two identical Address objects
- When the equals method is called on these objects
- Then the result should be true

Test Scenario 2: Null Object
- Given one Address object and a null object
- When the equals method is called on these objects
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 3: Different Object Types
- Given one Address object and one non-Address object
- When the equals method is called on these objects
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 4: Same Class, Different Attributes
- Given two Address objects with different street1, city or zipcode attributes
- When the equals method is called on these objects
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 5: Same Class, Same Attributes
- Given two Address objects with the same street1, city and zipcode attributes
- When the equals method is called on these objects
- Then the result should be true

Test Scenario 6: Both Objects are Null
- Given two null objects
- When the equals method is called on these objects
- Then the result should be false (as the equals method cannot be called on a null object)

Test Scenario 7: Comparing Object with Itself
- Given a single Address object
- When the equals method is called comparing the object with itself
- Then the result should be true
