Test Scenario 1: Identical Objects
- Given two identical Address objects
- When the equals method is called on one of them with the other as an argument
- Then the result should be true

Test Scenario 2: Different Objects
- Given two different Address objects
- When the equals method is called on one of them with the other as an argument
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 3: Null Object
- Given an Address object and a null value
- When the equals method is called on the Address object with null as an argument
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 4: Different Class Object
- Given an Address object and an object of a different class
- When the equals method is called on the Address object with the different class object as an argument
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 5: Object Equals Itself
- Given an Address object
- When the equals method is called on this object with itself as an argument
- Then the result should be true

Test Scenario 6: Different Addresses with Same Values
- Given two different Address objects with identical street1, city, and zipcode values
- When the equals method is called on one of them with the other as an argument
- Then the result should be true

Test Scenario 7: Different Addresses with Different Street1 Value
- Given two different Address objects with different street1 values but identical city and zipcode values
- When the equals method is called on one of them with the other as an argument
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 8: Different Addresses with Different City Value
- Given two different Address objects with identical street1 values but different city and identical zipcode values
- When the equals method is called on one of them with the other as an argument
- Then the result should be false

Test Scenario 9: Different Addresses with Different Zipcode Value
- Given two different Address objects with identical street1 and city values but different zipcode values
- When the equals method is called on one of them with the other as an argument
- Then the result should be false.
