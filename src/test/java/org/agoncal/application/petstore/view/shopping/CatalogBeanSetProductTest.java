"""
Scenario 1: Valid Product is Set
Details:
  TestName: testValidProductSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setProduct method correctly sets the product when a valid product is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid product object.
    Act: Invoke the setProduct method with the valid product.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product field of the class has been set to the provided product.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the product field has been set correctly. This is important in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the product details are correctly stored for further processing.

Scenario 2: Null Product is Set
Details:
  TestName: testNullProductSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setProduct method when a null product is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not create any product object.
    Act: Invoke the setProduct method with null.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product field of the class is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the product field has been set to null when a null product is provided. This is important in the context of error handling as it ensures that the application can handle null inputs gracefully.

Scenario 3: Product is Reset
Details:
  TestName: testProductReset
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the setProduct method when it is invoked to change the product that has already been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid product object and set it using the setProduct method.
    Act: Create a different valid product object and invoke the setProduct method with the new product.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the product field of the class has been updated to the new product.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the product field can be updated. This is important in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the application can handle changes in product details.
